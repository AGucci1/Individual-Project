        <p>Hello! My name is Arjun Gujjula, a CIS student at Kennesaw State University. Creating this website has been an enjoyable project that has allowed me to showcase the skills I’ve gained throughout my academic journey. Although this is my first website, it has been an exciting and fun experience, and I’ve learned a lot along the way.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore more about my work and connect with me through the contact page. Thank you for visiting!</p>
